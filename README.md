## How to run Kafka locally

You need to have docker installed and do

```
run docker compose up -d
```

It will serve a kafka ui dashboard in port 8080

## Running the producer

The producer code is in the producer folder and serves a small scaffold that contains the configuration of the producer.

Inside the producer folder make sure to `yarn install` and after `yarn start`

## Running the consumer

The consumer code is in the consumer folder and serves a small scaffold that contains the configuration of the consumer.

Inside the consumer folder make sure to `yarn install` and after `yarn start`
